powerUp
=======

Power up the device print for given number of times and print results

This program should switch device on / off and test it, for given number of times.

Wish list
======

1) When powering on test if the device alive- for each device there will be diferent test.
2) botting the device should be via NFS & tftp -- For each device there will be diferent image.
3) Some way to add tests when the units boots to the OS using GUI or Documintation.
4) Logging all the power ups need's to be logged and documented. Web interface will be nice.
5)
