powerUp
=======

Power up the device print for given number of times and print results

This program should switch device on / off and test it, for given number of times.

Wish list
======

- When powering on test if the device alive- for each device there will be diferent test.
- botting the device should be via NFS & tftp -- For each device there will be diferent image.
- Some way to add tests when the units boots to the OS using GUI or Documintation.
- Logging all the power ups need's to be logged and documented. Web interface will be nice.
 


ToDo
====
* Based on fit-PC3 with FM-SER Linux Mint installed.


-  Write script that will power ON / OFF the relay.
-  Check if test for device alive can be done within the script ( Probaly for some devices can be done ).
-  Define initial devices for implimintation.
-  Boot over nfs the device and document all the process.
-  Writing some initial test when booted.
-  On the fit-PC3 side some kind of gui if the device booted or not.
